          The Studio 7 is constructed by using the best-in-class premium audio components, a
          high-quality build process and a meticulously-refined speaker enclosure. By joining
          those individual elements into one distinctly beautiful package, leeds was able to
          create a sound qualtity that is never heard before in the streaming speaker segment.
